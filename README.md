#Corner Grocer Item Tracking Program

This program, titled "Corner Grocer Item Tracking Program," is designed to analyze text records of items purchased  at a grocery store. The primary goal was to help the store rearrange their produce section by understanding the purchase frequency of different items. This was achieved through a C++ program that reads from a text file, calculates the frequency of each item, and displays the results in various formats such as a histogram.

#Strengths

This program is particularly straight forward and is very easy to use/navigate. You can display the purchase amount in number form or a histogram to have a more visual output of the store's best sellers.

#Areas for Enhancement

A lot of features can be added to enhance the program and give it more versatility. The code cuold also have more comprehensive checks for error handling inputs. 

#Challanges

The most challanging part of this project was getting the histogram generation to work, but after learning more about std::map and reading more in the C++ documentation it was a piece of cake.

#Transferable Skills

I think that the ability to break down problems and split it up into managable tasks is beneficial to future projects. Using the maps for frequency counts also soldified my understanding of data structures. I also got to create documentation for this program which isn't something I'm used to doing. An important skill in collaborative enviroments.

#Readability

I used the "company" coding handbook, adhered to naming conventions and wrote detailed comments to increase the programs readablility and maintainablility. I also structured the program into functions and a class, making the codebase easier to modify.
